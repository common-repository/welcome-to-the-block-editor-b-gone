== Description ==

Finally get rid of that welcome message that's showing up even if you've been using Gutenberg for years!

For an even better experience in Gutenberg, use together with [Fullscreen mode B gone](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fullscreen-mode-b-gone/) and [Fatso](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fatso/).

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add and edit any posts, pages or custom post types without being welcomed over and over again
